# If the paths contain the '%' character, this is a wildcard to map
# from Subversion path to Git branch name. For example:
#   "/releases/foobar-%" : "v%"
# Will result in this mapping:
#   /releases/foobar-0.0.1 -> v0.0.1

# If true, tags are created as annotated tag objects, rather than just
# refs to the head of the history of the tag. This is done by taking the
# change at the head of the history, discarding it, and creating a tag
# object in its place, reusing the commit message from the discarded
# commit. This behavior works for most Subversion tags, where the tag
# was created by a 'svn cp' from one path to another. As a sanity check,
# the tree of the head commit is checked to ensure that it matches the
# tree of the parent commit. If it does not, a normal "ref tag" is
# created.
